This is an R Markdown document for first peer assessment of Reproducible Research course . 

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r echo =FALSE}
#setwd("C:\\Users\\Moaaz\\Documents\\GitHub\\RepData_PeerAssessment1" );
##install.packages("R.utils")
#library(R.utils)
unzip("activity.zip")

```
```{r echo = TRUE}
dt <- read.csv( "activity.csv")
head(dt)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
While  ignoring the missing values in the dataset.

```{r echo = TRUE}
acts <- dt[!is.na(dt$steps),]
acts$date <- factor(acts$date) 
daily_steps<- aggregate(acts$steps, list(acts$date),sum)
colnames(daily_steps) <- c("DayDate" , "TotalSteps")
```

1. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r echo = TRUE}
hist(daily_steps$TotalSteps , breaks= 10, 
     col = "green" , main="Total daily steps histogram" , xlab ="Total steps count") 
```

2. Mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r echo = TRUE}
stepsDaymean <- mean(daily_steps$TotalSteps)
stepsDaymedian <-median( daily_steps$TotalSteps)
```
The mean of total daily steps count is `r stepsDaymean` steps/day  and median is `r stepsDaymedian` steps/day  .


##What is the average daily activity pattern?

Caculating the average number of steps taken with in each 5-minute interval, averaged across all days.

```{r echo = TRUE}
interval_steps<- aggregate(acts$steps, list(acts$interval),mean)
colnames(interval_steps) <- c("interval" , "AvgSteps")
```
Ploting average stepes taken for each time interval across all days.

```{r echo = TRUE}
plot ( x=interval_steps$interval , y = interval_steps$AvgSteps 
       , type ='l' , col = 'blue' , main = "Average steps on 5-minute interval" 
       ,xlab = "Interval" , ylab ="Average Steps")
```

To determin Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps. Getting maximum average steps count per interval.

```{r echo = TRUE}
TopInterval <- interval_steps[ interval_steps$AvgSteps
                               ==max(interval_steps$AvgSteps),]

```

Interval `r TopInterval$interval` contains the maximum number of average steps which is `r TopInterval$AvgSteps` steps.

##Imputing missing values
```{r echo = TRUE}
NaRowsCnt <- NROW(dt[is.na(dt$steps),])
NaRows    <- dt[is.na(dt$steps),]

```
1. Dataset contains `r NaRowsCnt` missing values.

2. Using mean for a day to substitute the missing values at that day.

``` {r echo = TRUE}
NaRows<- merge( NaRows , interval_steps)
NaRows$steps <- NaRows$AvgSteps
```

3. Producing new dataset whith filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.
``` {r echo = TRUE}
NewActs<- rbind(acts , NaRows[,1:3])
NewActs <- NewActs[order(NewActs$date),] 
```


4. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and these mean and median.
``` {r echo = TRUE}
daily_steps2<- aggregate(NewActs$steps, list(NewActs$date),sum);
colnames(daily_steps2) <- c("DayDate" , "TotalSteps") ;
hist(daily_steps2$TotalSteps , breaks= 10, 
     col = "green" , main="Total daily steps histogram with NA substituted") ;
stepsDaymean2 <- mean(daily_steps2$TotalSteps) ;
stepsDaymedian2 <-median( daily_steps2$TotalSteps);

comp<-data.frame(WithNA_Mean =stepsDaymean , NewMean = stepsDaymean2 , WithNA_Median= stepsDaymedian , NewMedian = stepsDaymedian2) 

```

  The mean of total daily steps count is `r stepsDaymean2` steps/day  and median is     `r stepsDaymedian2` steps/day  .
  
 Compare the expected mean and median considering missing values, with the calculated mean after filling missing data by each day average steps of the day of missing values . 

``` {r echo = FALSE , results='asis' ,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE }
library(xtable);
x<- xtable(comp);
MeansTable = print ( x , type='html');

```
  
  There is no change in mean and median of both datasets. 


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?


1.  Adding a factor variable "weekday" in the new dataset <with filled NA> with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r  echo=TRUE}
weekday<- function ( x )  
{ dd<- weekdays(as.Date (x)) ;
  if ( dd== "Sunday" | dd == "Saturday"  ) 
    ret = "weekend" 
  else ret = "weekday"    
  ret ;
}

NewActs$weekDay <- sapply (NewActs$date ,weekday)
NewActs$weekDay <- factor(NewActs$weekDay )
```

2. plotting 5-minute interval on (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

```{r  echo=TRUE ,fig.width=5,  fig.height=4, }
weekday_Interval_steps<- aggregate(NewActs$steps, list(NewActs$weekDay , NewActs$interval ), mean)
colnames(weekday_Interval_steps)<- c("weekDay" , "interval" , "AvgSteps")
weekend_steps <- weekday_Interval_steps[weekday_Interval_steps$weekDay == "weekend",]
weekday_steps <- weekday_Interval_steps[weekday_Interval_steps$weekDay == "weekday",]

par ( mfrow = c( 1,1))
plot ( x= weekend_steps$interval , y = weekend_steps$AvgSteps 
       , type ='l' , col = 'blue' , main = "Weekend average steps"  
       ,xlab = "Interval" , ylab ="Average Steps")

plot ( x= weekday_steps$interval , y = weekday_steps$AvgSteps  , type='l' , col = 'green',
         xlab= "Interval" , ylab= "Avg Steps rate" , main= "Weekday average steps")

```

From weekend and weekday average steps trend plots, we can notice that during weekends loads are distributed during the day intervals as usually (500 - 2000) > 50 steps/interval, 
But at weekday load is focused on narrower time slots and maximized between intervals( 500 - 1000) > 50 steps/interval.
